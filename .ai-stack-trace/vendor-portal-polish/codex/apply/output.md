**Summary**
- Updated the Phase 1 audit with admin role checks and password reset duplication details in `docs/ai-gated/vendor-portal-polish/audit.md:1`.

**Next Step**
- If you approve, I’ll move to Phase 2 and draft the decision summary + target flow diagram + schema impact assessment.

**Tests**
- Not run (Phase 1 audit only).
