This comprehensive technical specification outlines Phase 3 development for the Sanity Auto-Mapper Plugin, transforming it into an enterprise-grade, autonomous schema management system.

PREREQUISITES:
• Phases 1 & 2 complete and production-tested
• Proven with real-world repositories
• Performance validated at scale

DELIVERABLES:

1. CUSTOM INTEGRATION BUILDER - Visual designer allowing users to teach the plugin about ANY integration through drag-and-drop field mapping, transformation builder, and reusable integration packs.

2. CONTINUOUS MONITORING SYSTEM - Real-time schema health monitoring with intelligent alerting, automatic issue detection, performance tracking, and automated resolution through configurable automation rules.

3. ANALYTICS DASHBOARD - Comprehensive insights with health metrics, activity tracking, integration status, performance monitoring, trend analysis, and automated reporting (daily/weekly/monthly).

4. TEAM COLLABORATION - Multi-user features including approval workflows, role-based permissions, comment threads, change attribution, shared configuration, and team-wide standards enforcement.

5. PROGRAMMATIC API - REST API and SDK for external tool integration, enabling CI/CD integration, automated testing, custom tooling, and external monitoring systems.

6. TURN-KEY FIELD PACKS - Pre-built schema sets for eCommerce, CRM, and Content Management with one-click installation, pre-configured relationships, validation rules, and integration mappings.

7. MIGRATION TOOLS - Advanced schema transformation including split/merge operations, field extraction, structure normalization, and version migration support (Sanity v2→v3).
