TASK: Perform a read-only audit of CSS classes and layout usage across the repo
to identify spacing, padding, margin, and text-size issues causing overlap,
clutter, or unreadable UI — especially in custom components.

REPO IN SCOPE:
- fas-sanity ONLY

PRIMARY SYMPTOMS:
- Components visually overlap or feel cramped
- Text appears too small or inconsistent
- Buttons, headers, or metadata collide
- Custom components ignore spacing conventions

FILES / AREAS TO INSPECT:
- All custom React/TSX components
- Tailwind utility usage in JSX/TSX
- packages/sanity-config/src/styles/tailwind.css
- Any component-level CSS or inline styles

AUDIT OBJECTIVES:
1) Identify components lacking sufficient padding or margin.
2) Identify inconsistent spacing scales (mixed px, rem, Tailwind sizes).
3) Identify flex/grid containers missing safety rules:
   - min-width: 0
   - min-height: 0
   - gap usage instead of margins
4) Identify text sizes that reduce readability:
   - text-xs overuse
   - hardcoded font sizes
5) Identify absolute positioning or negative margins causing collisions.
6) Identify opportunities for a shared spacing & typography baseline.

RULES:
- READ-ONLY audit
- DO NOT modify files
- DO NOT suggest ad-hoc per-component hacks
- Prefer systemic fixes over one-off tweaks

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write report to docs/reports/css-spacing-readability-audit.md
- List problem areas grouped by category (spacing, text, layout)
- Call out the WORST offenders explicitly
- Recommend ONE minimal baseline spacing & typography system
- Clearly separate 'systemic fixes' vs 'component-specific fixes'
