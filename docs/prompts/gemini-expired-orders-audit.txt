TASK: Investigate why expired checkout orders do not display customer details
in the Sanity Desk (Orders and Customers views).

CONTEXT:
- Repo: fas-sanity
- Orders with status = "expired" exist.
- Customer documents exist.
- Orders list shows blank or "—" for customer.
- Customers list shows many entries labeled "Customer" with 0 orders.
- Some emails appear duplicated.
- At least one customer correctly shows an order count.

Gemini MUST:
- Inspect order schema and relevant fields (customerRef, customerEmail, etc.)
- Inspect customer schema and identity fields (email, name, stripeCustomerId)
- Inspect order creation logic (Stripe webhook, save-order)
- Determine whether expired sessions skip customer linking
- Inspect Desk Structure queries for Orders and Customers
- Identify filters that may exclude expired orders
- Identify fallbacks that cause display name = "Customer"

Gemini MUST NOT:
- Propose fixes
- Modify schemas
- Modify code
- Assume intent

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
docs/reports/expired-orders-customer-audit.md

The report must clearly state:
- Where the customer link is expected to be created
- Whether expired orders bypass that logic
- Whether customer queries exclude expired orders
- Whether name/email resolution fails due to missing fields
- Whether duplicate customers are created per email
