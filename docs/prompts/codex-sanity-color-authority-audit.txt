TASK: Audit why Sanity Studio colors defined via CSS variables are not taking effect.

REPO IN SCOPE:
- fas-sanity ONLY

PRIMARY SYMPTOM:
- CSS variables under body.sanity-studio-theme are defined but UI colors do not change.

AUDIT OBJECTIVES:
1) Confirm whether body.sanity-studio-theme is present on <body> at runtime.
2) Confirm CSS file load order relative to Sanity UI styles.
3) Identify whether styled-components inject inline styles overriding variables.
4) Identify whether Sanity UI components read JS theme tokens instead of CSS vars.
5) Identify any remaining selectors redefining --studio-* after the authoritative block.

FILES / AREAS TO INSPECT:
- packages/sanity-config/src/components/studio/StudioLayout.tsx
- packages/sanity-config/src/styles/tailwind.css
- sanity.config.ts
- styled-components usage (ThemeProvider, StyleSheetManager)
- build pipeline for CSS inclusion

RULES:
- READ-ONLY audit
- DO NOT modify files
- DO NOT suggest fixes until root cause is proven

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write report to docs/reports/sanity-color-authority-audit.md
- Explicitly state which layer is authoritative for colors
- Explicitly state why CSS variables are ignored or overridden
- Recommend ONE minimal fix (no alternatives)
