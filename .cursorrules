# Cursor AI Rules

## UI Development
Read and follow all rules in AI_GUIDELINES.md, specifically the Sanity UI Enforcement Policy.

## Key Requirements
- Use @sanity/ui components exclusively for all UI primitives
- Use theme tokens for spacing, colors, and typography
- Never introduce custom HTML/CSS for elements that exist in @sanity/ui
- Propose refactors for non-compliant code before implementing
- Follow the safety protocol for all UI changes

## Before Every UI Change
1. Check if @sanity/ui has a component for this use case
2. Assess impact on dependent files
3. Preserve all existing functionality
4. For large refactors, propose before implementing
