# Define Shippable Products

## Overview
In the Parcelcraft Settings page, navigate to the **Shippable products** tab to view all products defined in Stripe. Enable the **Shippable** option for any product you want to appear in your unshipped orders list.

## Automatic Shipment Weight Calculation

To enable automatic weight calculation:

1. Locate the product in the list
2. Enter the product weight in the designated field
3. Save your changes

**Weight Formula:**
```
(PRODUCT WEIGHT × PRODUCT QUANTITY) + PACKAGING WEIGHT = TOTAL WEIGHT
```
*Note: Enter package weight on the Carrier defaults settings page.*

## International Shipments

For international orders, provide:

- **Customs Description** — Used for automatically generated customs sheets
- **Tariff Code** — Required to determine applicable duties and taxes

See [International Shipping](./international-shipping.md) for detailed guidance.
