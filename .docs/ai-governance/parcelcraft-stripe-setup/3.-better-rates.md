# Strategies to Find the Best Shipping Rates

[EasyPost](https://www.easypost.com/discounted-shipping) accounts include automatic discounted shipping rates with select carriers—no application or qualification required. View the complete list of carriers offering discounts at: [https://www.easypost.com/discounted-shipping](https://www.easypost.com/discounted-shipping)

Our advertised shipping rates reflect EasyPost’s discounted pricing.

## Adding Your Own Carrier Accounts

If you have negotiated rates with carriers like **UPS**, **FedEx**, or **DHL**, add your carrier accounts at: [https://app.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=carriers](https://app.easypost.com/account/settings?tab=carriers)

The carrier management page has two sections:

1. **EasyPost Carrier Accounts:** Use EasyPost’s discounted rates, billed through EasyPost.
2. **My Carrier Accounts:** Use your negotiated rates, billed directly by your carrier (click “Add carrier” to set up).

> **Note:** After adding carriers in EasyPost, refresh the ParcelCraft Shipping App to see your updated carrier options.

## Getting the Best Rates

Create labels in the ParcelCraft Shipping app to compare price quotes across all carriers. The system returns only rates compatible with your shipment specifications.

### Example: USPS First Class Letter

To see specific rates like the **$0.69** First Class rate (which is better than the public rate of $0.73), select:

- **Carrier:** USPS
- **Packaging:** Letter
- **Weight:** Under 3.5 ounces

### Optimized Workflow

When you request a quote, the app returns only rates compatible with the shipping information (weight, packaging type, and carrier) you provide.

1. **Initial Quote:** Get a quote from "All carriers" first to see a broad range of options.
2. **Refined Quote:** Once you narrow down a carrier, re-quote with that specific carrier and specialized packaging.

- _Example:_ Sending a letter in **UPS letter packaging** for overnight shipments is significantly cheaper than sending a package with specified dimensions of the same size.

**Important:** When quoting “All carriers,” the system removes packaging type and carrier specifications for compatibility. **Always request carrier-specific quotes** to see the best rates for your exact requirements.
