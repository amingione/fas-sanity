TASK: Enforce approved contract decisions in strict enforcement mode.

ENFORCEMENT MODE:
You are operating in NON-INTERACTIVE ENFORCEMENT MODE.
You are not designing, refactoring, or improving code.

SOURCE OF TRUTH (AUTHORITATIVE):
docs/prompts/employeeHub.md.

CONTRACT CONSUMPTION RULES:

- The contract decisions document must be consumed top-to-bottom.
- Sections marked REJECTED are strictly out of scope.
- APPROVED sections define the only permissible changes.
- Absence of approval is equivalent to rejection.
- In case of ambiguity, STOP and make no changes.

This document is binding.
No behavior, logic, file, or field may be changed unless explicitly approved there.
No inference, extrapolation, or “reasonable assumption” is allowed.

--------------------------------------------------

RULES (STRICT):

- Implement ONLY what is explicitly approved in the contract
- Do NOT infer missing steps or intentions
- Do NOT refactor, optimize, rename, or reorganize code
- Do NOT modify schemas unless explicitly approved
- Do NOT modify UX or UI unless explicitly approved
- Do NOT introduce new behavior, defaults, or fallbacks
- Do NOT change execution order unless explicitly approved
- Do NOT consolidate logic across actions unless approved
- If approval is unclear or missing, STOP and make no changes

--------------------------------------------------

DECISION PRECEDENCE RULES:

- SCHEMA CHANGES override all other sections.
- If SCHEMA CHANGES are REJECTED, no schema files may be touched even indirectly.
- LOGIC CHANGES may not introduce schema, query, or desk changes unless explicitly approved.
- QUERY / DESK changes may not alter logic unless explicitly approved.

--------------------------------------------------

FILES ALLOWED TO CHANGE (EXACT LIST):
- <LIST EXACT FILE PATHS>

If a required change would touch a file not listed above:
- STOP execution
- Do NOT modify any files

--------------------------------------------------

FILES FORBIDDEN TO CHANGE:
- All files not explicitly listed above
- All schema files unless explicitly approved
- All API routes unless explicitly approved
- All Netlify functions unless explicitly approved
- All frontend repositories

--------------------------------------------------

BEHAVIORAL PARITY REQUIREMENT:

- Any behavior that is currently working must remain unchanged unless explicitly approved.
- Existing successful flows must not regress.
- No action may gain additional side effects unless explicitly approved.

--------------------------------------------------

VALIDATION REQUIRED:

- Lint must pass
- Existing governance rules must remain intact
- No new warnings or errors introduced
- No new network calls added
- No new dependencies added
- No behavior coupling introduced
- Runtime behavior must match the approved contract exactly

--------------------------------------------------

NEGATIVE ASSERTION REQUIREMENT:

Before stopping, you must internally verify that:
- All REJECTED sections were left completely untouched
- No files outside the allowed list were modified
- No implicit coupling was introduced between independent actions
--------------------------------------------------

COMPLETION RULE:

When enforcement is complete:
- Stop execution
- Do NOT suggest improvements
- Do NOT explain changes
- Do NOT modify additional files
- Do NOT continue work beyond approved scope
